# Conduct a Security Audit

## Project Overview
- This project involved analyzing the security posture of **Botium Toys**(a fictional comapny) by reviewing their scope, goals, and risk assessment report. I completed controls and compliance checklists to identify gaps in security practices and provide recommendations to improve the organization’s security.

- This activity was completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  
- All resources included in this repository are **provided by the course materials** and are included here for reference to show the work completed.


## Objectives
- Assess existing assets, systems, and controls.
- Evaluate compliance with regulations.
- Identify areas for improvement in security posture.
- Provide actionable recommendations for risk mitigation.

## Project scenario
- The detailed scenario for this project is available in the PDF linked below. It describes the fictional company, its IT environment, and the challenges that formed the basis for this security audit. This document was used as a reference to complete the audit, risk assessment, and compliance checklists. All content in this repository has been rewritten and adapted to ensure originality.

## Steps
### 1. reviewed the **ToySecure Inc.: Audit Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report**  
- Analyzed the provided scope, goals, and risk assessment to understand the current security posture of the organization. Verified the listed assets, identified existing vulnerabilities, and evaluated the risk score. Assessed alignment with NIST CSF principles and documented observations for further audit steps.

### 2. completed the **Controls and compliance checklist**
- Assessed existing security controls, such as access management, network protection, encryption, and backup processes. Determined which controls were implemented and which were missing to identify gaps in the security framework.
- Reviewed adherence to key regulatory frameworks, including PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC (Type 1 & 2). Evaluated policies and processes for data security, access control, breach notification, and compliance with international and industry standards.
- Provided actionable recommendations for controls and compliance best practices to strengthen the organization’s security posture.
